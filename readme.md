# Not done yet!

Hi, i have been working on this project on my spare time.
Right now it is not as good as i wish it was, soo i will update the guide to run only when it's all done.

The goal of the project is to recreate Tinder functions on a web app, and on the future make a android app to learn React Native.

Frontend: React, Typescript, Styled-Components, Axios, Ant Design.
Backend: Nodejs, Express, Typescript, TypeORM.
